# intro-3D-dev-class-projects
Unity demo projects for an undergraduate Introduction to 3D Development class.Currently being referenced by Seattle WA and Elizabeth NJ school systems to build a secondary senior level computer science class in virtual reality. 

We are currently funded by NJ Department of Education for development of secondary VR curriculum for national release. Curriculum will be developed in collaboration with Oculus Education, Unity Education, the Elizabeth, NJ school system and the Seattle, WA school system. Curriculum will be publicly released for any school system to incorporate and any educator to add new curriculum. We are currently focused on introduction to 3D and VR development with C# in the Unity creation engine. We have recently finished part 1 of the curriculum, introduction to 3D development, tested it in our undergraduate game development program before handing the material to the high school curriculum developers to refine for their educational needs.
